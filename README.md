# @Azkyll - Aspiring backend/fullstack dev

Hi! My name is Irina but you can call me Azie ðŸŒ¸ I used to be a physics student, and now I'm trying to get full-time into my passion for programming.
My main focus is realistic physics simulation (particles, gravity, thermodynamics -- if it can be coded, I **will** do it at some point), but I do play with other concepts, ideas or puzzleS.

I code in Python and C++, and I'm still learning the latter ðŸŒ¸ I'd love to get into functional programming when I'm confident enough with C++. _Azie Haskell era incoming???_

I **really** would love to collaborate on simulation projects, anything with heavy mathematics involved ðŸŒ¸ Why make your computer do the calculations when you could let mathematics take the wheel?

Don't hesitate to contact me here on GitHub for inquiries or collaboration prospects. I will _at some point_ put my other socials on this page, but I don't feel like it right now.

Currently working on : 
 - Graphical calculator using SFML
   

Thanks for reading!~
